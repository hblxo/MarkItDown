## About

A very small project to learn how to use Qt.

## Goals // Key learnings

My (self-imposed) goals were to learn how to create a simple interface with :
- text formatting,
- text menus,
- quick menus,
- contextual menu,
- text input, 
- keyboard shortcuts,
- saving options,
- Qt translate system,
- tab management, 
- and so on.
